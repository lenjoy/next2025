- **Cloudflare Workers**: API endpoints and server-side logic

### **Data Flow**:
1. Speaker data collected from NEX-T 2025 official sources
2. Stored in structured format in D1 database
3. API endpoints serve data to frontend via REST API
4. Frontend renders interactive speaker cards and detail modals
5. Real-time search/filter implemented client-side for performance
